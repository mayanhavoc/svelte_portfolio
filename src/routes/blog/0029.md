It seems to me that it is the appropriate time to put some resources into having, intellectualy honest and objective conversations about governance.

We need to be able to discuss and learn about the different political systems and ideologies that have existed throughout history.

We need to discuss and debate their advantages and disadvantages, how they were or were not implemented in government and most importantly, why they succeeded, and eventually failed.

We need to have honest conversations about the flaws in systems like capitalism, communism, liberatarianism, etc. without bias and the influence of propaganda.

We also need to discuss what does ethics and morality mean in the modern world and what is their role in the society. We need to do the same for religion.

It is, in my opinion, of great importance that the "everyday" individual engage, not only in discussion, but on learning the historical as well as theoretical and philosophical underpinnings of the different systems of governance and the alternatives being proposed today.
