# Finding and Evaluating the Right Marketing Opportunity

## The Three Views on Entrepreneurial Opportunities

There are three views regarding entrepreneurial opportunities:

1. Opportunity recognition: The entrepreneur recognizes supply and demand and matches them through a new or existing firm.
1. Opportunity discovery: The entrepreneur determines that either supply or demand exists, and the other side has to be discovered. For example, there is demand for cures for certain illnesses but no supply.
1. Opportunity creation: The entrepreneur infers that neither supply nor demand exists in any obvious manner, and one or both may have to be created. Beanie Babies is an example of opportunity creation.

## Characteristics of a Good Opportunity

A good marketing opportunity:

- Creates significant value for customers by solving an important problem or filling a significant unmet need for which the customer is willing to pay a premium price.
- Offers significant profit potential to the entrepreneur and investors.
- Represents a good fit with the capabilities of the entrepreneur and the management team in terms of industry experience and knowledge, as well as managerial, financial, and technical capabilities.
- Offers sustainability over time, is not based on a fad, and is durable and will last over the long term.
- Can obtain financing.

## Finding Marketing Opportunities: Where to Look

### Environmental scanning

Environmental scanning includes:
Examining trends/changes in the marketplace.
Watching and talking to consumers.
Looking for structural societal changes.
The major environmental forces assessed through environmental scanning are social, economic, technological, competitive, and regulatory.

### Social Change

Social changes, such as the growing ethnic population, aging population, time poverty, and eco-consciousness, are dramatically impacting the types of entrepreneurial opportunities available in the marketplace. Americans are becoming more experiential, willing to try new things and seek new experiences. This has opened up opportunities for ecopreneurs and try-sumers.

### Economic Change

One of the significant structural changes in our economy is the shift from a manufacturing economy to services, even an experience-based economy. Out of every consumer dollar in the US, 70 cents is spent on services, not products.

### Technological change

Rapid and ongoing technological change is one of the most important triggers of entrepreneurial opportunity. Aspiring entrepreneurs must determine the change's magnitude, generality, and commercial viability.

### Competitive Change

There is intensely local and globalized competition in almost every industry sector. Mergers and acquisitions have changed the competitive dynamic by opening and closing opportunities for entrepreneurial firms. For example, the airline industry has seen consolidation and application of a hub and spoke design, allowing entrepreneurial startups to enter the industry with a point-to-point air travel design. There has also been a major competitive shift toward inter-type competition.

### Regulatory Change

Both deregulation and increased regulation can create entrepreneurial opportunities. For example, the legalization of marijuana in some states has created opportunities for entrepreneurs in the cannabis industry.

## Conclusion

Finding and evaluating the right marketing opportunity requires identifying environmental forces that affect the market and looking for significant unmet needs or problems that customers are willing to pay a premium price to solve. This can be achieved through environmental scanning and assessing the magnitude, generality, and commercial viability of changes in social, economic, technological, competitive, and regulatory forces.
