## Viewport units: `vh`, `vw`, vmin, vmax

`vh` - % viewport height
`vw` - % viewport width
Note: On mobile views, `vh` can cause content overflow. Use media queries.

How do these differ from `width: 100%`? `width:100%` sets width to 100% of the parent container.
`vmax` uses the viewport's largest dimension (width or height). So it's % of the bigger viewport size.

### Using vmin and vmax with padding

If height is `100vh`, also set padding with `vh`. The padding adjusts with the viewport height.
Using `vmin` and `vmax` with font size `vw` for font size increases/decreases the font with the viewport width. Good for titles but not paragraphs. Use `em` for typography.
`vmin` is good for titles. It shrinks as the viewport gets smaller but grows until one viewport dimension becomes smaller. It stays proportional.
Pro tip: Test these units on different viewports.
