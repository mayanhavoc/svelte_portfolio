# Using marketing research to ensure entrepreneurial success

## Introduction

This post discusses the role of marketing research in entrepreneurial success. It defines marketing research and outlines methods to obtain and apply information needed to make decisions about the venture. Finally, it shows that marketing research is vital in reducing venture risk and increasing success.

## Marketing research: Defined

**Marketing research.** The process of defining a marketing problem or opportunity, collecting and interpreting information, and acting on it to improve chances of entrepreneurial success.

**Secondary data.** Existing data already collected and available to the entrepreneur.

**Primary data**. The purpose of the research is to gather new data.

**Depth interviews**. Detailed individual interviews with potential customers.

**Focus groups.** Informal interview sessions in which six to ten potential customers are brought together in a room with the entrepreneur/moderator to discuss their needs/wants and types of products/services they might be interested in.

**Fuzzy front-end methods (FFE).** Unusual market research techniques designed to identify elusive customer tastes or trends.

**Lead users**. Innovative and early adopters, trendsetters.

**Observation**. The research method involves watching how people behave mechanically or in person.

**Ethnographic research.** Entrepreneurs and other trained observers seek to discover subtle emotional reactions as consumers encounter products in their "natural use environments," such as in homes, cars, or hotels.

**Survey**. The technique used to generate data is by asking people questions and recording their responses on a questionnaire.

**Experiment**. The manipulation of an independent variable (cause) and the measurement of its effect on the dependent variable (effect) under controlled conditions.

**Conjoined studies.** A technique to provide insight into customer preferences for a particular brand or product features and their willingness to "trade-off" one part for more of another component.

**Probability sampling**. Using precise rules to select the sample such that each population element has a specific known chance of being selected.

**Non-probability sampling**. Using arbitrary judgment to select the sample so that the chance of selecting a particular population element is either unknown or zero.

**Marketing information system**. A system that involves people, computers, and communication systems designed to satisfy your enterprise's need for information - information that you will use to make decisions about your business.

**Data mining**. The extraction of information from the databases uses that can be used to determine the best strategies for growing and sustaining the enterprise.

**The central purpose of marketing research is to help uncover viable marketing opportunities.**

It's also used to assess the needs and wants of customers and provide information to help shape the venture's marketing program. When conducted properly, marketing research can solve most marketing-related problems. 

## Types and methods of marketing research

This section discusses types of marketing information and methods to obtain meaningful and relevant marketing information that will be critical to venture success.

The two major types of marketing data are **secondary data** and **primary data**.

### Secondary Data

Data collected and available to the entrepreneur. Problems with secondary data are that it's only sometimes available or not current/pertinent to the current venture.

**Sources of secondary data**

- [USA.gov](http://USA.gov)
- www.census.gov
- http://factfinder.census.gov
- Business Directories
- Business periodicals
- Newspapers
- Magazines
- Trade associations
- Online databanks that provide specialized data services.

### Primary Data

**After you have exhausted all sources of secondary data**, you may still have questions that need to be answered. There are a variety of ways to generate primary data:

- Voice of Consumer (VOC) feedback

We will discuss the following primary data or VOC methods: depth interviews, focus groups, observation, fuzzy front-end methods, surveys, experiments, and conjoint research.

**Depth Interviews**

Depth interviews are detailed, individual - free-flowing conversational-style - with potential customers to obtain relevant information. They are often recorded on video or audio.  

If you want to uncover

- what makes customers tick
- what problems they have and how you might solve them

You want to draw basic themes from the research to investigate through more quantitative approaches.

**Depth interviews** provide an excellent opportunity to explore and compare differences and similarities among prospective target customers and spend valuable one on one time with target customers exploring a single individual's responses without others present.

Typical, depth interviews will be used in the following situations:

1. When it is easier to reach target customers
2. When there is a better cost-benefit compared to other methods
3. When it is preferable to collect responses without group influence
4. When probing is part of the information collection process
5. When a product, service, or process is being tested for usability
6. If the topics you are investigating are highly sensitive(i.e. diseases, illnesses) or personal(i.e. finances).
7. If you wish to probe experts and get feedback on your venture concept

**Focus groups**

 In informal interview sessions, six to ten potential customers are brought together in a room with the entrepreneur/moderator to discuss their needs/wants and the types of products/services they might be interested in.

Research suggests keeping groups of no more than eight → mini-group approach → allows you to obtain essential and observable reactions to product stimuli and allow for more focused discussion leading to new ideas or refinements.

In a Focus Group situation, the moderator will pose questions and encourage participants to answer in their own words and discuss with each other, often while watched through a two-way mirror (participants should be informed that they are being observed or taped). Now it is possible to do **FGs** online.

### Example

Entrepreneurs trying to decide between three different ventures (a restaurant, a clothing store, and a sporting goods store) discovered participants were not interested in any of the proposed ventures but instead suggested that the entrepreneur consider an entirely new concept, a concept of great interest to the potential customers. It became an instant success.

**FGs** are practical when:

1. Consensus or debate is required to explore possible disparate views of target customers or experts;
2. Point-counterpoint among target customers to generate and share ideas;
3. Broad, exploratory topics are covered and allow target customers to generate and share ideas;
4. When the interaction between respondents can draw our latent issues, not just perceived ones;
5. When group dynamics aid in the discovery process.

When deciding between **depth interviews** and **FGs,** determine your objectives first and then pick the best approach.

**Fuzzy front-end methods**

Unusual market research techniques designed to identify elusive customer tastes or trends.

**For example, motivational research and projective techniques to uncover what makes customers happy or what frustrates them.**

**For example, using "sentence completion" to uncover customer needs (perceived or latent).**

You must engage your "initial first customers" to determine what makes them tick and their reactions to your venture concept.

**Observation**

The research method involves watching how people behave mechanically or in person.

**For example, retailers can use electronic cameras to count the number of customers entering or leaving the store.**

**For example, one toy company was permitted to observe children playing with toys at a nursery school and was able to come up with new toy concepts from the observations.**

**Ethnographic research** where ****entrepreneurs and other trained observers seek to discover subtle emotional reactions as consumers encounter products in their "natural use environments," such as homes, cars, or hotels, is gaining popularity. Can obtain customer insights that traditional research methods like surveys can't.

Another novel approach is the entrepreneur as **mystery shopper**. The entrepreneur goes "undercover," posing as a real customer to determine how well the provider performed, obtaining insight into how competitors deal with customers.

**Entrepreneurial marketing spotlight.** Dr. Hy Mariampolski, managing director of an innovative marketing research firm QualiData Research, Inc, believes in delving deeper into understanding customers' everyday reality, at home, in their neighborhoods, and at work. At the same time, shopping or during leisure can uncover customer needs, including unmet needs.

Personal observation can be helpful and flexible, but it can be costly and unreliable. While compliance can reveal what people **do**, it cannot determine **why they do it.** This is usually accomplished through surveys.

**Surveys**

The most common research method of generating new or primary data, or VOC, is used to create data by asking people questions and recording their responses on a questionnaire.

Surveys can be conducted:

- by personal interview (face-to-face)
- mail
- telephone
- online

**Important issues when using surveys:**

1. You have to talk to the right potential customer.
2. You have to ask the right questions.
3. The respondent has to understand the questions.
4. The respondent must know the answers to the questions.
5. The respondent must answer the questions.
6. The respondent must answer the questions truthfully.
7. The entrepreneur must understand the answers provided.

It's essential not just to ask the **right questions**, but to **properly word those questions.** It is critical that marketing research questions are worded precisely so that everyone interprets the question similarly.

**Different question formats**:

- Open-ended → the respondent answers in their own words.
- Closed-ended or fixed-alternative → respondent checks an answer
- A fixed alternative question with three or more choices → often uses a scale (**, e.g., semantic scale → 9-point scale with adjectives of opposite meanings**) or a Likert scale (**, e.g., 1 to 5, 1 dislike, five really like**).

**Asking questions is always obtrusive**

- Any questions involving demographic information should always be asked at the end of the survey.
- You should always use demographic information categories consistent with what is used in the industry sector or the U.S. Bureau of the Census (or similar).

**Experiments**

The manipulation of an independent variable (cause) and the measurement of its effect on the dependent variable (outcome) under controlled conditions. Marketing experiments can establish cause-and-effect relationships (causal research). In marketing experiments, the independent variables are usually one of the marketing mix variables -sometimes called "marketing drivers."

A potential difficulty with experiments is that an extraneous (or outside) variable can distort the results of an investigation and affect the dependent variable.

Experiments can be conducted in the field or the laboratory.

Field experiments can be an excellent way to determine people's reactions to changes in marketing mix elements. **Test marketing** is the most common field experiment to gauge customer response to a marketing offer.

The Internet has opened up opportunities for market testing of products, packaging, advertising, etc.

**Conjoint studies**

A technique used to provide insight into customer preferences for a particular brand or product features and their willingness to "trade-off" one part for more of another component.

**Conjoint research** uncovers each customer's relative importance to different brand or potential product feature levels. The entrepreneur presents the potential customer with a set of brands/products where the features of the brands/products vary.

### Example

A tool manufacturer presents descriptions of power tools that vary the price, the motor power, warranty length, etc., and discovers that the household user wants a cheaper power tool and the professional contractor wants a powerful motor and is prepared to pay a higher price for the device. The manufacturer then developed two lines of tools.

## Other research issues

### Research design

> In my experience, entrepreneurs who want to uncover opportunities or test the viability of their venture concepts should probably use a combination of research methods, including exhausting all sources of secondary data, engaging in ethnographic research, following up with depth interviews to probe the customer and then deploy conjoint studies to properly configure the proposed offering, and engage in some field testing to refine.

### Sampling

The first and most critical sampling question is: "Who will be sampled?"

Another question concerns sample size: "How big should the sample be?" In general, a larger sample is more precise, but proper sampling can allow a smaller subset of the total population to provide a reliable measure of the whole.

Finally, "How do you select the sampling units?"

**There are two basic sampling techniques**

- Probability sampling - Using precise rules to select the sample such that each population element has a specific known chance of being selected.
- Non-probability sampling - The use of arbitrary judgment to select the sample so that the chance of selecting a particular population element is either unknown or zero. Non-probability samples are often used when
    - time and budgets are limited and
    - most often used for **exploratory research** purposes

### Proper data collection and analysis

Most researchers agree that the data collection stage of the research process is one of the significant sources of error in marketing research. Some of the mistakes resulted from a range of problems, from failure to select the right respondents to the incorrect recording of observations.

The data analysis level depends on the nature of the research and the information needed to provide insight into the marketing issue.

The most widely used technique for organizing and analyzing marketing data is cross-tabulation. This method is beneficial for market segmentation analysis.

### Research conclusions and taking action

It is vital to decide whether or not:

1. proceed with the opportunity
2. adjust or adapt the nature and scope of the opportunity based on the information uncovered, including customer input/feedback
3. kill the opportunity

## Designing a Marketing Information System

Once you launch your venture, a marketing information system can help you stay close to the market, customers, and competitors. A marketing information system involves people, computers, and communication systems. It is designed to satisfy your enterprise's need for information that will be used to make decisions about your business.

The marketing information system will contain databases and statistical packages/models that can analyze data and present reports for interpretation; it should also allow you to engage in **data mining**.

### Example

Mining the customer purchase data from a supermarket, the owner discovered that men buying diapers in the late evening often also purchased a six-pack of beer. So they placed diapers and beer near each other in an end-aisle display and increased sales.

## Key takeaways

- Access to information and using it wisely is critical to entrepreneurial success.
- Marketing research can help uncover and test your opportunities.
- Always exhaust secondary data before using more expensive and time-consuming primary data methods.
- Use a creative approach to obtaining information
- Look for market and customer insight and act on insight.
