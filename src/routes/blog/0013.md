## Nix Notes

### Nix basic commands overview

Installing a package

```Bash
$ nix-env -i git
installing 'git-1.9.3'

$ git --version
git version 1.9.3
```

Install custom package (nix expression) without installing it to a profile

```Bash
nix-build ./path-to-file.nix
```

Removing a package from a profile

```Bash
nix-env -e package.name
```

Garbage collector

```Bash
nix-env --delete-generations 10d
nix-collect-garbage
```

## Nix main advantages

- Atomic upgrades
- Rollbacks
- Reproducibility

## Quick Overview

### Nix package manager

Installing a package via nix

```Bash
$ nix-env -i git
installing 'git-1.9.3'

$ git --version
git version 1.9.3
```

This example installs Git and its dependencies and makes it available to the user.

**What sets Nix apart from other package managers is the way that is stores packages.**

```Bash
$ readlink -f $(which git)
/nix/store/hn79nsyhnlwqyspwqsbmgzacny35hn3w-git-1.9.3/bin/git
# ðŸ‘† Packages don't live in shared directories like /usr/bin or /usr/lib
```

In Nix, each package has its own directory underneath the Nix store (/nix/store). 
The characters `hn79nsyhnlwqyspwqsbmgzacny35hn3w` in the /nix/store represent the cryptographic hash of the inputs used to build the package. This includes source code, packages, build script and dependencies (e.g., a C compiler and external libraries).

### How does Nix work?

Whenever you install, upgrade or uninstall a package via `nix-env`, Nix builds a tree of symbolic links (called a *user environment*) pointing to the installed packages. The current user environment is available through the $PATH environment variable. Whenver a nix package is installed, upgraded, uninstalled, nix will download and build the dependencies and build a **new** user environment. This new version will not affect the current user's original environment in any way.

All nix does once everything is installed, is update the symlink `/nix/var/nix/profiles/default` to point at a new user environment.

![Figure 1 ](https://imgopt.infoq.com/fit-in/1200x2400/filters:quality(80)/filters:no_upscale()/articles/configuration-management-with-nix/en/resources/fig3large.jpg)

In the same way, removing a package from a profile (`nix-env -e package-name`) will build a new symlink tree from which the symlinks to the specified package have been removed. **Removing a package from a profile doesn't cause it to be deleted from the disk, since the user may want to roll back at some point.**

Whenever the uses wishes to free up the storage space from packages no longer used, nix allows for packages to be *garbage-collected*. This works by deleting any path in the Nix store which is not reachable from a "root". Roots include the symlinks in /nix/var/nix/profiles but also any open files (to prevent active programs from being garbage collected). This requires telling Nix that you don't need to roll back any more, e.g.:

```Bash
# ðŸ‘‡ tell Nix you don't want to roll back to any profile version older than 10 days 
$ nix-env --delete-generations 10d
# ðŸ‘‡ actual deletion command
$ nix-collect-garbage
```

### Building packages

*Nix expressions* are purely functional programming language that tell Nix how to build packages, e.g.:

```Bash
with import <nixpkgs> { };

# ðŸ‘‡ high-level abstraction that provides standard Unix dependencies such as GCC and Make
stdenv.mkDerivation {
    # ðŸ‘‡ inputs to the build
  name = "nano-2.3.2";

  # The source code tarball, downloaded into some place in the Nix store.
  src = fetchurl {
    url = ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/nano/nano-2.3.2.tar.gz;
    sha256 = "1s3b21h5p7r8xafw0gahswj16ai6k2vnjhmd15b491hl0x494c7z"};

  # The dependencies, referring to variables in <nixpkgs>.
  buildInputs = [ ncurses gettext ];

  # Build script, this is actually unnecessary as mkDerivation assumes standard Autoconf-style packages by default
  buildCommand =
    ''
      tar xf $src
      cd nano-*
      ./configure --prefix=$out
      make
      make install};
```

You can install such a package via nix-env -i nano, but you can also build it without installing it into a profile:

```Bash
nix-build ./nano.nix
```

```Bash
/nix/store/22y58w45fskjz6k7xyryx9s6ri22j2bq-nano-2.3.2
```

This will create a symlink `./result` pointing to the result of the nix expression in the Nix store, you can test the package by running `./result/bin/package-name`.

## Ad hoc developer environments

What is a shell environment?
An environment that gives you access to exact versions of packages specified by Nix.

### Searching package attribute names

Anything thatâ€™s in the [official package list](https://search.nixos.org/packages) can become part of the shell environment.

To search a package:

```Bash
$ nix-env -qaP git
# ðŸ‘‡ attribute name     ðŸ‘‡ package name
gitAndTools.gitFull     git-2.25.0
gitMinimal              git-2.25.0
```

(continues ...)

## Anatomy of a nix expression

```Bash
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> { } }:

pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation {
  pname = "gruvbox-css";
  version = "latest";
  src = ./.;
  phases = "installPhase";
  installPhase = ''
    mkdir -p $out
    cp -rf $src/gruvbox.css $out/gruvbox.css
  '';
}
```

This creates a package named `gruvbox-css` with the version `latest`.
