## `em`'s and `rem`'s

### Core concept

When using `em`'s to set font size, it's set relative to the parent element's font size. Likewise, using `em`'s for spacing attributes (`margin`, `padding`) is set relative to that element's font size.

## `em`

Font sizes in `em`'s are set relative to the parent element's font size. One `em` equals the parent's font size, often defaulting to 16px. If there's no parent font size, it defaults to the body's font size (16px).

`em` uses compounding, meaning font sizes compound going down the DOM tree. So, for example, if a grid parent element has a font size of `2em` and a child element has a font size of `2em`, the child font size will be `4em` because it's twice the parent's font size.

## `rem`

According to MDN, `rem` exists to fix `em`'s compounding problem. `rem` means root `em` and is relative to the html element's font size (or `::root`), not the body. Using this practice makes `rem`'s more consistent.

### Using `em`'s and `rem`'s for spacing

For `margin`, `padding`, or other properties besides font size, `em`'s look at the font size instead of the parent element. However, `rem` always looks at the root font size and is more consistent.

```CSS
h1 {
    font-size: 2.5em;
    /* ðŸ‘† margin relative to its font size, not its parent */
    margin-bottom: 1em;
}
```

### Pro tip

Use `rem` for font sizes to avoid compounding issues.

## When Are `em`'s Most Useful?

`em`'s are useful for buttons. Setting `padding`, `margin`, etc., on a button with `em`'s lets you easily adjust these properties by changing the font size. Using `em`'s often makes designs more adaptable. However, use `rem` to keep spacing consistent (equal left and right spacing).

```CSS
.btn {
    display: inline-block;
    `padding`: 1em 3em;
}
.btn--small {
    /* ðŸ‘‡ Uses font size to adjust .btn--small's `padding` relative to .btn's (0.5 of 1 and 3 `em`) */
    font-size: 0.5em;
}
```

## `em`'s and Media Queries

Adjusting the font size with media queries makes designs more adaptable to screen sizes.

```CSS
html {
    font-size: 16px;
}
@media (min-width: 700px) {
    html {
        font-size: 25px;
    }
}
```
