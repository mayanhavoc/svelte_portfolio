## Colt Steele's Mastering TypeScript

## Type annotations

## Exercises

[workbook](./Notes.md)

We declare the type of a variable using **type annotation**. To create a type annotation, after the variable, introduce a colon `:` and then add the type.

```TypeScript
const myVar: string = 'String var'
```

The general syntax of a type annotation looks something like this:

```TypeScript
    let myVar: type = value
    // The type ðŸ‘† goes on the LEFT of the = sign
```

### Primitive Types

- Number
- Null
- Any
- String
- Undefined
- Never
- Boolean
- Void
- Unknown

### Object Types

- Object
- Tuple
- Array
- Enum
- Function
- etc

## Compiling TypeScript

In the terminal:

```Bash
tsc path/to/file.ts
```

You get back:
The file is in .js format.
Feedback in the terminal.

## Type Inference

TypeScript's compiler can infer types from certain values. As a result, TypeScript remembers a values' type even if it's not annotated, and it will enforce that type going forward.

```TypeScript
let x = 27;
// ðŸ‘† We create a variable 'x' with a value, no type annotation
x = 'Twenty-seven';
// ðŸ‘† This will result in an error. TypeScript will 'infer' that it's a number and enforce it.
```

## The Any Type

A type unique to TypeScript, it's a 'catch all' that turns off type checking.

### Pro-tip

Avoid using the `any` type as it defeats the purpose of using TypeScript altogether.

## Delayed initialization and implicit Any

There is one situation where **Type annotation** is desired: when you declare a variable **separate** from when it's initialized.

```TypeScript
let foundMovie;

for (let movie of movies){
    if (movie === "Amadeus"){
        foundMovie = "Amadeus";
    }
}
```

If we hover over the `foundMovie` variable, the compiler will recommend we use a more specific type than `any`.

To avoid this, we can tell the compiler what the type of our variable will be when it's eventually assigned a value.

```TypeScript
let foundMovie: string;

for (let movie of movies){
    if (movie === "Amadeus"){
        foundMovie = "Amadeus";
    }
}
```

## Function parameter types

We can specify the type of function parameters in the function definition.
**Typing parameters is just like typing variables.**
