<p>Learning targets provide tangible <strong>goals</strong>.
Learning targets transfer ownership for meeting objectives to the student.</p>
<p>“The seemingly simple work of reframing objectives written for teachers to learning targets, written for - and owned by - students, turns assessment on its head. The student becomes the main actor an in assessing and improving their learning.” - Elena, Former Odyssey Student, On Her First Days In A New School.</p>
<ol><li>I can define learning targets.</li>
<li>I can explain how to derive learning targets from standards.</li>
<li>I can describe how to unpack a learning target with a student.</li></ol>
<p>Concrete goals are written in <strong>student-friendly</strong> language.</p>
<p>Describes what students will:</p>
<ul><li>Learn</li>
<li>Be able to do it after the end of class, unit, project, or course.</li>
<li>Being with an “I can” statement.</li>
<li>Used intentionally -&gt; conveys to students specific aim.</li></ul>
<p>Learning targets are:</p>
<ul><li><p>Measurable and concrete, assessable verbs (e.g., identify, compare, analyze). The verb suggests how the learning target will be assessed.</p></li>
<li><p>Specific -&gt; referring to a particular context of a lesson, project, or case study.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Focused on the intended learning</strong>, not the intended doing.</p>
<ul><li>Phrased as statements about skills or knowledge students will develop (as opposed to what they will complete).</li></ul></li>
<li><p>Matched to the cognitive process demanded of students (e.g., knowledge, reasoning, skill).</p></li></ul>
<h2 id="${"how-are-learning-targets-derived"}"><a aria-hidden="${"true"}" tabindex="${"-1"}" href="${"#how-are-learning-targets-derived"}"><span class="${"icon icon-link"}"></span></a>How are learning targets derived?</h2>
<ul><li>Nesting support, or daily learning targets, within long-term learning targets.<ul><li>Long-term learning targets are derived from standards (e.g., Common Core), which can be bundled together to focus on instruction and assessment (bundling standards into long-term learning targets makes the language plain and helps students understand where they are headed).</li></ul></li>
<li>Supporting targets, often broken down into <strong>daily learning targets</strong><ul><li>Derived from long-term targets</li>
<li>Daily anchor for instruction</li>
<li>Supporting targets <strong>nest</strong> within long-term targets</li>
<li>Created by breaking long-term targets into manageable chunks to guide students daily.</li></ul></li></ul>
<h2 id="${"unpacking-learning-targets"}"><a aria-hidden="${"true"}" tabindex="${"-1"}" href="${"#unpacking-learning-targets"}"><span class="${"icon icon-link"}"></span></a>Unpacking learning targets</h2>
<p>For students to become leaders of their learning</p>
<ul><li>They must be aware of what the target is.</li>
<li>Understand and be able to articulate where their performance is in relation to mastering the target.</li></ul>
<p>Reaching, or not reaching, a learning target represents critical information for students about</p>
<ul><li>What they can or can’t do.</li>
<li>What they still need to learn.</li></ul>
<p>It is essential to unpack and track learning targets with students so that the purpose of the day’s work is evident.</p>
<p>To unpack a target:</p>
<ul><li>Review domain-specific and academic vocabulary in learning target</li>
<li>Ask students to focus on the verb in the target (e.g., describe, sort, analyze) and ensure they know what it means to do cognitive work.</li>
<li>Explain to students how they will show that they have mastered the target (e.g., classwork, assessments).</li></ul>

<ol><li><p>Review lesson plans for upcoming work</p>
<ul><li>Do they include solid and clear targets in student-friendly language that describe the intended student learning?</li></ul></li>
<li><p>Do you regularly ensure that your students are clear on what they need to know or can do by the end of the lesson?</p></li>
<li><p>Review lesson plans for target-assessment match.</p>
<ul><li>Do your assessments - formative and summative - give students ample opportunity to demonstrate their progress toward meeting learning targets?</li></ul></li></ol>`;
